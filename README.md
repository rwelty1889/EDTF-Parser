# EDTF-Parser

An ANTLR parser for Levels 0 & 1 of Extended Date Time format.

https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/

Currently needs some updates - license mismatch between repo and headers (bsd 2 clause vs 3 clause), and last ran in 2 year old Netbeans with 2 year old ANTLR.
Once updates are handled, building a testing framework shall begin.
